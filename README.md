Knowledge3D (K3D) is an initiative from EchoSystems AI Studios to build an open standard and toolkit for rendering artificial intelligence knowledge as a navigable three‑dimensional universe.  It fuses concepts from CAD geometry, vector databases and augmented‑reality mapping so humans and AI models can explore data side by side.

## White‑paper overview

The white‑paper "A 3D Vector Universe Standard for High‑Dimensional AI Knowledge" describes the core objective: create a universal 3D data format that lets users fly through interconnected datasets as if visiting planets in space.  Success is defined by knowledge navigability—intuitive traversal and reduced cognitive load—and by technical metrics such as frame rate, query latency and adoption by researchers.

Other companion documents expand on this vision:

* **AI model integration.** "AI Models and 3D Knowledge (K3D) Databases" explores how neural models could inhabit the same 3D data world, enabling immersive visualization and shared interaction.
* **Augmented reality use cases.** "Integrating Augmented Reality and AI: New Frontiers in Training, Learning, and Exploration" outlines how AR headsets can overlay K3D scenes onto the real world for education and field work.
* **CAD/vector database fusion.** "Merging CAD and Vector Database Concepts into a 3D Knowledge Visualization Standard" and "Using AutoCAD’s 3D Vector Format as an AI Vector Database" discuss storing vector embeddings inside CAD-like geometry files so that standard 3D tools become knowledge browsers.

## TeleKnowledge vision

The companion paper *"Towards an Interactive __TeleKnowledge__ Internet: A 3D Virtual World for Businesses, Humans, and AI"* expands on the long‑term ambition for Knowledge3D.  It imagines a **Spatial Web** where self‑hosted virtual buildings replace today’s static pages.  Using open protocols such as the IEEE 2874 Hyperspace Transaction Protocol (HSTP) and its HSML modeling language, any organization could serve a richly interactive 3D environment under its own domain while still linking seamlessly to others.  Built‑in decentralized identifiers control access so both humans and AI agents can explore knowledge spaces safely and transparently.
