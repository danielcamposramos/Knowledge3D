# K3D White Paper (Draft)

This document will house the markdown version of the white paper titled "A 3D Vector Universe Standard for High-Dimensional AI Knowledge." Until the full text is converted from its DOCX source, this file provides a short summary and placeholder for future edits.

Knowledge3D aims to define an open standard for visualizing large-scale vector data as an explorable 3D universe. The white paper will detail the rationale, technical approach, and planned extensions.
