# Developer Guidelines

This repository follows the **EchoSystems K3D Collaboration Action Plan**. The plan sets out guiding principles and a four-pillar technology stack for building the Knowledge3D platform.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Form ↔ Meaning** – every pixel, vector and API route clarifies an idea.
2. **Show, don’t scroll** – favor explorable 3D spaces over long feeds of text.
3. **Edge-first** – deliver static content when possible and only compute dynamically when necessary.
4. **Open-by-default** – schemas, codecs and SDKs live in the public repo.

## Four-Pillar Stack
- **Design Craft** – universal grid, automated contrast and accessible typography.
- **Persuasive Psychology** – labels and social loops inside every flow.
- **Frontend Velocity** – Next.js with React-Three-Fiber and continuous deployment.
- **System Design & DevOps** – observable, idempotent APIs and cost-aware scaling.

Developers should consult [`spec/k3d_node_schema.json`](../spec/k3d_node_schema.json) when modeling new data structures and use the action plan as a reference for upcoming milestones.
