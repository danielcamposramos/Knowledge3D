# Agent Guidelines

This repository uses Codex agents to automate certain development tasks. Contributors should review the task list in [CODEX.md](CODEX.md) before starting work. The roadmap in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) explains the intended project phases.

- Follow the tasks in CODEX.md when adding new files or features.
- Keep docs/ROADMAP.md updated as milestones are reached.
